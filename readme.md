# Webrtc Playground

## Choices

I've chosen to use simple-peer to start learning with as it seems to have the most popularity right now according to [this one internet chart](https://www.npmtrends.com/easyrtc-vs-peerjs-vs-rtcpeerconnection-vs-simple-peer-vs-simplewebrtc) I've found.

While not neccisary to play with webrtc, I've chosen to style my samples with [Bulma](https://bulma.io) which is also new for me.

## Whats in here

Under the `demo` folder I'm completing the samples available off the [simple-peer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-peer) package page.
